Version 0.14 has been released.

Version 0.11 has been released.
This release is compatible with the new plugin API of <strong>Teamspeak 3.1</strong> (Plugin API 21) and does work with all previous server versions of TS3VIDEO.
There is no new release of the server. You can keep running your 0.8.</p>

This release is only an update for the Teamspeak plugin API. It is basically the same as 0.8.</p>
<p><strong>2016-05-12</strong>
Version 0.8 has been released.
I went a step back to Qt 5.4.1 (used by v0.5, very stable), because of some network problems with Qt 5.6.0.
The VC14 api-xxx-xxx-* DLLs are no longer required. VC12 is used as compiler now.</p>
<p><strong>2016-05-06</strong>
Version 0.7 has been released.
It is only a tiny fix for 64-bit systems and the <em>missing dll</em> error.
It includes vc_redist.x64.exe and install it.</p>
<p><strong>2016-05-05</strong>
Version 0.6 has been released.
It is no longer compatible with previous versions and requires an update
of servers aswell.
It is now possible to stream with a custom resolution.</p>
<p><strong>2015-10-01</strong>
Version 0.5 has been released.
It fixes a few minor bugs and introduces an online update-checker.
It also uses the new master-server, which provides public video servers
for everyone.</p>
<p><strong>2015-09-05</strong>
Version 0.4 has been released and is available for <a href="./downloads">download</a>.
